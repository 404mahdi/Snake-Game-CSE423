## 🕹️ Project Overview

This project presents a **3D remake** of the classic **Snake** game, developed using **Python** and **OpenGL (PyOpenGL)**.  
While the snake moves on a **2D grid plane (X-Y)**, the entire environment is rendered in **3D** with **adjustable camera perspectives**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 3D environment with dynamic camera controls.
- Snake moves on a 2D grid (up, down, left, right).
- Collect apples to grow and increase score.
- Self-collision results in game over.
- Randomly spawning **power-ups**:
  - _Speed Boost_, _Shrink_, _Double Points_.
- Randomly spawning **negative effects**:
  - _Slow Down_, _Reverse Controls_.
- **Moving Barriers** as dynamic map hazards.
- **Level progression** with increasing difficulty:
  - Level 1: Basic speed, 5 apples to complete.
  - Level 2: Increased speed, static obstacles.
  - Level 3: Fast-moving food and dynamic hazards.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **PyOpenGL**
- **GLUT**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
   ```

2. Execute the game:
